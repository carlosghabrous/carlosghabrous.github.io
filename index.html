      <p>Carlos would love to build physical objects with his own hands, but unfortunately he is only 
          reasonably good at writing software. He does not like introducing himself much using the 3ed person, 
          and neither does he like his arms crossed in resume photos. Carlos loves listening to music and playing drums, 
          suffering in triathlons of all distances, learning languages, reading and cooking with a cold beer in his hand. 
          Not all at the same time though. 
          <br>
          He is very much concerned about climate change, and tries to educate his son and 
          daughter into respect for others and the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
          My background is in Telecommunication Engineering, and I consider myself a self taught software engineer who tries to beat 
          the impostor syndrome by keeping on learning new things and by applying my knowledge into cool projects. When I am working 
          I spend most of my time trying to figure out why my software doesn't work as I expect, talking to people to reach agreements
          and trying to help others. Things that interest me are software usability and user satisfaction, microservices architecture, data engineering and AI.
